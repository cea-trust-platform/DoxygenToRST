# DoxygenToRST

Used to convert xml generated by doxygen into rst files that can be included in a sphinx documentation.

This achieves two goals:

- integrating code documentation from doxygen into the sphinx documentation seamlessly, using the visual identity of the sphinx theme

- allows to cite classes, methods and namespaces easily from other places in the documentation


## Some remarks

- This is mostly tailored for TRUST/TrioCFD projects. Other projects might face various bugs.

- This is probably still incomplete in term of usage of the doxygen content

- This might become a python package in the future, might be useful
